## Checklist 

Package authors should strive to include everything on this checklist in their package in the way that is standardized and accepted for the major repositories for the software language, e.g., [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html) for R packages or [PyPI](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/) for python packages.
